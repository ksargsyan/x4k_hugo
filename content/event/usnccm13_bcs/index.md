abstract: "For a complex model with a large number of input parameters, building<br>Polynomial Chaos (PC) surrogate models is challenged by insufficient<br>model simulation data as well as by a prohibitively large number of<br>spectral basis terms. Bayesian sparse learning approaches are<br>implemented in order to detect a sparse polynomial basis set that best<br>captures the model outputs. We enhanced the Bayesian compressive sensing approach with adaptive basis growth and with a data-driven, piecewise-PC surrogate construction.<br>"
