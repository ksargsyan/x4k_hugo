abstract: "We address challenges that sensitivity analysis and uncertainty<br>quantification methods face when dealing with complex computational<br>models. In particular, climate models are computationally expensive and<br>typically depend on a large number of input parameters. We<br>consider the Community Land Model (CLM), which consists of a nested<br>computational grid hierarchy designed to represent the spatial<br>heterogeneity of the land surface. Each computational cell can be<br>composed of multiple land types, and each land type can incorporate<br>one or more sub-models describing the spatial and depth<br>variability. Even for simulations at a regional scale, the<br>computational cost of a single run is quite high and the<br>number of parameters that control the model behavior is very<br>large. Therefore, the parameter sensitivity analysis and uncertainty<br>propagation face significant difficulties for climate models. This<br>work employs several algorithmic avenues to address<br>some of the challenges encountered by classical uncertainty<br>quantification methodologies when dealing with expensive computational<br>models, specifically focusing on the CLM as a primary application.<br><br>First of all, since the available climate model predictions<br>are extremely sparse due to the high computational cost of model runs,<br>we adopt a Bayesian framework that effectively incorporates<br>this lack-of-knowledge as a source of uncertainty, and<br>produces robust predictions with quantified uncertainty<br>even if the model runs are extremely sparse. In<br>particular, we infer Polynomial Chaos spectral expansions that<br>effectively encode the uncertain input-output relationship and allow efficient<br>propagation of all sources of input uncertainties to outputs of<br>interest.<br><br>Secondly, the predictability analysis of climate models strongly suffers<br>from the curse of dimensionality, i.e. the large number of<br>input parameters. While single-parameter perturbation studies can<br>be efficiently performed in a parallel fashion, the multivariate<br>uncertainty analysis requires a large number of training runs, as well as<br>an output parameterization with respect to a fast-growing spectral basis set.<br>To alleviate this issue, we adopt the Bayesian view of compressive<br>sensing, well-known in the image recognition community. The<br>technique efficiently finds a sparse representation of the model<br>output with respect to a large number of input variables, effectively<br>obtaining a reduced order surrogate model for the input-output<br>relationship. The methodology is preceded by a sampling strategy that takes into account input parameter constraints by an initial mapping of the<br>constrained domain to a hypercube via the Rosenblatt transformation,<br>which preserves probabilities. Furthermore, a sparse quadrature sampling,<br>specifically tailored for the reduced basis, is employed in<br>the unconstrained domain to obtain accurate representations."
