abstract: "Residual neural networks (ResNets) feature extra connections between layers enabling <br>incremental learning between layers. Their infinite-layer limit, Neural ODEs (NODEs) <br>can provide insights into the role of depth in network architecture. In addition, <br>the mature field of differential equations can provide mathematical insights into <br>the NODE context and, as an extension, help better understand ResNets and <br>neural networks in general, opening doors for better training algorithms <br>and improved generalization performance.<br><br>Inspired by the continuous, NODE analogy, we will examine ResNet weight matrix parameterization <br>as functions of depth. The choice for parameterization affects the capacity of the network, <br>leading to regularization and a subsequent reduction of the generalization gap. <br>Further, drawn from the NODE analogy again, we study the role of stiffness as <br>a means of regularization for ResNets. We define a discrete version of <br>stiffness for ResNets, and implement penalization by it as a measure to <br>regularize the training. We will demonstrate the methods on applications of <br>DOE/SNL interest, ranging from materials science to climate models.<br><br><br>Shorter version:<br><br>Residual neural networks (ResNets) feature extra connections between layers enabling <br>incremental learning between layers.
