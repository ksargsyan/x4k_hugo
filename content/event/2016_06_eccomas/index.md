abstract: "Due to slow convergence, classical Monte-Carlo approaches are ineffective for computationally<br>intensive studies of complex models as they require prohibitively many sampled<br>simulations for reasonable accuracy. Targeting high-dimensional systems, we build computationally<br>inexpensive surrogate models in order to accelerate both forward (e.g., uncertainty<br>propagation and sensitivity analysis) and inverse (e.g., calibration) uncertainty quantification<br>studies. We apply Polynomial Chaos (PC) spectral expansions to build surrogate relationships<br>between output quantities and model parameters using as few forward model simulations as<br>possible.<br>For a complex model with a large number of input parameters, building a PC surrogate<br>model is challenged by high dimensionality: there is typically insufficient model simulation<br>data as well as a prohibitively large number of spectral basis terms. Bayesian compressive<br>sensing (BCS) approach is employed in order to detect a sparse polynomial basis set that best<br>captures the model outputs. We enhance the BCS algorithm with iterative basis growth and<br>reweighing that effectively searches polynomial space for an optimal, sparse basis set. The<br>resulting surrogate is then employed for forward uncertainty propagation and variance-based<br>sensitivity analysis, leading to dimensionality reduction. Besides proof-of-concept studies for<br>synthetic models, the technique is demonstrated on a Climate Land Model with more than 50<br>input parameters.<br>"
