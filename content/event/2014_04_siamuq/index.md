summary: Talk
abstract: "Surrogate construction for high-dimensional models is challenged in two major ways: <br>obtaining sufficient training model simulations becomes prohibitively <br>expensive, and non-adaptive basis selection rules lead to excessively large basis sets. <br>We enhanced select state-of-the-art tools from statistical learning to build efficient sparse <br>surrogate representations, with quantified uncertainty, for high-dimensional complex models. <br>Specifically, Bayesian compressive sensing techniques are supplemented by iterative basis growth <br>and weighted regularization. Application to an 80-dimensional<br>climate land model shows promising results.<br>"
