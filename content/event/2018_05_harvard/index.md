title: Embedded Model Error Representation for Bayesian Model Calibration
authors: ["Khachik Sargsyan, Xun Huan, Habib N. Najm"]
abstract: "Conventional Bayesian calibration often assumes the computational model can replicate the true mechanism behind data generation. However,
this idealization is generally not achieved for physical models since
they carry misspecification due to different parameterizations
and assumptions. While accounting for data noise and parametric uncertainties
has become routine in the uncertainty quantification context,
the same can not be said about model errors,
also known as model structural error, or model misspecification.
Ignoring model error can lead to overconfident
calibrations and poor predictive capability, even when high-quality
data are used. I will demonstrate a stochastically
embedded model correction approach that enables
predictions while respecting the underlying physics.
Employing polynomial chaos expansions
to represent the correction terms, the approach allows the
physical model to be treated as a black-box, followed by
efficient quantification, propagation, and decomposition of
uncertainty that includes contributions from data noise,
parameter posterior uncertainty, and model error.
Time permitting, the key strengths of this method will be demonstrated
on realistic engineering applications including chemical kinetics,
climate models and turbulence modeling."
