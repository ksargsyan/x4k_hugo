abstract: "Predictability analysis in stochastic reaction networks is typically<br>challenged by intrinsic noise.<br>We utilize non-intrusive spectral expansions to efficiently propagate<br>input parametric uncertainties<br>in the presence of intrinsic stochasticity. To address the curse of<br>dimensionality, orthogonal spectral<br>projections are performed using a sparse quadrature approach that is shown<br>to perform better than<br>High Dimensional Model Representation (HDMR) for the benchmark problem.<br>The methodology is illustrated for<br>the gene regulation network of the Bacillus Subtilis bacterium.<br>"
