abstract: "Computational models usually carry misspecification due to different parameterizations<br>and assumptions. Ignoring such model errors can lead to poor predictive capability, <br>even when high-quality data are used. It is thus crucial to quantify and propagate uncertainty<br>due to model error, and to differentiate it from parametric uncertainty<br>and data noise. Traditional approaches accommodate model error through<br>discrepancy terms that are only available for calibration quantities,<br>and generally do not preserve physical model constraints in subsequent<br>predictions. The ability to extrapolate to other predictive quantities<br>and to retain certain physical properties are often desirable and even required in many physical science and<br>engineering applications. We develop a stochastically<br>embedded model correction approach that enables these qualities,<br>and perform Bayesian inference of the correction<br>terms together with model parameters. Employing polynomial chaos expansions<br>to represent the correction terms, the approach allows<br>efficient quantification, propagation, and decomposition of<br>uncertainty that includes contributions from data noise,<br>parameter posterior uncertainty, and model error."
