abstract: "Parameter calibration often assumes the computational model<br>can replicate the true physical mechanism behind data generation. In<br>practice, however, computational models rely on parameterizations,<br>assumptions, and constitutive relations that entail significant model<br>structural error. Ignoring such model errors can lead to overconfident<br>calibrations and poor predictive capability, even when high-quality<br>data are used for calibration. It is thus crucial to quantify and<br>propagate uncertainty due to model error, and to differentiate it from<br>parametric uncertainty and data noise. Traditional approaches<br>accommodate model error through discrepancy terms that are only<br>available for model output quantities used for calibration, and<br>generally do not preserve physical constraints in subsequent<br>predictions. The ability to extrapolate to other predictive quantities<br>and to retain certain physical properties (e.g.  conservation<br>principles, positivity constraints) is often required in physical<br>science and engineering applications.<br><br>We develop a stochastically embedded model correction approach<br>that enables these qualities, and illustrate computational methods for<br>Bayesian inference of the correction terms together with model<br>parameters [Sargsyan et al., 2018]. Representing the correction terms<br>using polynomial chaos expansions, the new formulation becomes a<br>density estimation problem [Sargsyan et al., 2015], and allows efficient<br>quantification, propagation, and decomposition of uncertainty that<br>includes contributions from data noise, parameter posterior<br>uncertainty, and model error. The framework provides principled tools<br>for the analyst, e.g. to examine the utility of corrections to<br>specific suspect model components, and to identify the model<br>components where model improvements are relevant for agreement with<br>the data.<br><br>We demonstrate the key strengths of this method on realistic<br>engineering applications, including climate models, chemical<br>kinetics, and reacting flow simulations from a supersonic jet engine design [Huan et al. 2017]."
