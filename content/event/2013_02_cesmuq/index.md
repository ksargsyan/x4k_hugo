abstract: "Uncertainty quantification (UQ) studies often demand prohibitively<br>many simulations of computationally expensive climate models. <br>In such situations, surrogate models are usually employed instead of<br>full physical models. We rely on Polynomial Chaos (PC)<br>spectral expansions to build surrogate relationships between output<br>quantities of interest and model parameters using as few forward model<br>simulations as possible. These surrogate models are<br>inexpensive and greatly accelerate both forward and<br>inverse UQ studies such as global sensitivity analysis and parameter<br>calibration, respectively.<br><br>Motivated by the Community Land Model (CLM), we develop a PC-based<br>surrogate construction in presence of a large number of input<br>parameters and non-smooth behavior of the forward model. Namely,<br>given a sparse set of training simulations, Bayesian compressive<br>sensing is implemented to obtain a PC surrogate with an optimal,<br>reduced basis set that best captures the model output<br>behavior. Furthermore, an iterative algorithm is proposed to improve <br>the accuracy of the surrogate while reducing the dimensionality of the<br>PC representation. Since purely polynomial-based surrogates are not<br>accurate enough for strongly nonlinear models, we generalize the<br>surrogate construction to a piecewise PC expansion that relies on<br>clustering and classification of input parameter samples according to<br>model output values. The resulting sparse, piecewise PC expansion is used to<br>perform global sensitivity analysis and dimensionality reduction for the <br>80-parameter CLM.<br>"
