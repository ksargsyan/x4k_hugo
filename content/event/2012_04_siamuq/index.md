abstract: "Bayesian inference is implemented to obtain a polynomial chaos expansion for<br>the response of a complex model, given a sparse set of training runs. For<br>polynomial basis reduction, Bayesian compressive sensing is<br>employed to detect basis terms with strong impact on model output<br>via relevance vector machine. Furthermore, a recursive algorithm is<br>proposed to determine the optimal set of basis terms. The<br>methodology is applied to global sensitivity studies of the Community<br>Land Model.<br><br><br>"
