summary: Talk
abstract: "Over the last decade, improved measurement capabilities and computational resources have greatly accelerated method development for uncertainty quantification (UQ) in computational models of physical systems.<br><br>This talk will give an overview of UQ in computational models. In particular, I will focus on probabilistic methods for forward and inverse UQ studies with an emphasis on Polynomial Chaos (PC) expansions and Bayesian inference, respectively. I will introduce both classical and more advanced methods, highlighting major challenges with synthetic demonstrations and, time permitting, with physical applications, including CFD and climate models.<br><br>The talk will bias towards capabilities and methods available in UQTk, which is a lightweight C++/Python software package developed and maintained at Sandia-California (www.sandia.gov/UQToolkit).<br><br><br>"
