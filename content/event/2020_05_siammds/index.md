abstract: "When investigating complex physical models with compute-intensive tasks, such as uncertainty quantification or model calibration, a surrogate construction is often a necessary step. Using an ensemble of model training simulations, the development of a model surrogate is cast as a supervised machine learning (ML) problem. For expensive models with a large number of input parameters, the critical challenge is to create high-fidelity surrogates with as few model training evaluations as possible. Our application of interest is a simplified land model (sELM) mimicking the land component of the Energy Exascale Earth System Model (E3SM), and simulating the feedback between the climate and carbon interactions while accounting for the biochemistry.<br>We build on a long-short term memory (LSTM) recurrent neural network, taking into account the already known interactions between input processes and output QoIs. Such a physics-informed architecture is shown to outperform vanilla implementations of LSTM or feed-forward neural networks. We then employ the resulting tree-LSTM surrogates to carry out global sensitivity analysis and model calibration given observational data on select QoIs.<br><br><br>"
