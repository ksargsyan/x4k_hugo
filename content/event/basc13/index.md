abstract: "In computationally intensive studies, such as model calibration and<br>uncertainty quantification, surrogate models are usually employed instead of<br>full physical models. However, surrogate construction for high-dimensional<br>models is challenged in two major ways: a) obtaining sufficient number of<br>training model simulations becomes prohibitively expensive, and b)<br>non-adaptive surrogate basis selection rules lead to excessively large basis<br>sets. To alleviate these difficulties, select state-of-the-art tools are<br>ported from statistical learning to build efficient sparse surrogate<br>representations, with quantified uncertainty, for high-dimensional complex<br>models. Specifically, Bayesian compressive sensing techniques are enhanced by<br>iterative basis growth and weighted regularization. Application to an<br>80-dimensional climate land model shows promising results, leading to<br>efficient global sensitivity analysis and dimensionality reduction.<br>"
