abstract: "Conventional applications of Bayesian calibration typically assume the model replicates the true mechanism behind data generation. However, this idealization is often not achieved in practice, and computational models frequently carry different physical parameterizations and assumptions than the underlying `truth'. Ignoring model errors can  then lead to overconfident calibrations and predictions around values that are, in fact, biased. Most statistical methods for bias correction are specific to observable quantities, do not retain physical constraints in subsequent predictions, and experience identifiability challenges in distinguishing between data noise and model error. We develop a general Bayesian framework for non-intrusive \emph{embedded} model correction that addresses some of these difficulties, by inserting a stochastic correction to the model input parameters. The physical inputs and correction parameters are then simultaneously inferred. With a polynomial chaos characterization of the correction term, the approach allows efficient quantification, propagation, and decomposition of uncertainty that includes contributions from data noise, parameter posterior uncertainty, and model error. We demonstrate the key strengths of this method on both synthetic examples and realistic engineering applications.<br><br><br>MS Title: Characterizing model inadequacy in Bayesian inference<br>MS Abstract:<br>Models of complex physical systems are often formulated based on approximations and assumptions that may be in error in some situations. In other cases, the highest fidelity model of the system may be intractable or too computationally expensive for its intended use. In these cases the models are often replaced with less expensive lower fidelity models, which necessarily introduce additional errors.<br>When such “inadequate models” are used to make predictions, the errors introduce uncertainties in those predictions. Characterization of uncertainties due to model inadequacy introduces formulation and algorithmic challenges. Of particular interest are inadequacy representations that allow characterizing uncertainties in the predictions, thus informing consequential decisions or enabling multi-fidelity approaches.<br>To this aim, it is often helpful to embed inadequacy in the models and to formulate them based on knowledge about the physical system.<br>This introduces additional algorithmic challenges when the model is formulated in terms of ordinary or partial differential equations, since inadequacy representation is often in terms of an infinite dimensional uncertainty.<br>This minisymposium brings together researchers from diverse fields to discuss advances in treatment of model errors, with particular focus on physics-based representation of inadequacy, including the incorporation of stochastic terms in the model equations, and Bayesian calibration of the resulting stochastic models."
