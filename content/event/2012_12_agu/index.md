abstract: "Uncertainty quantification capabilities have been boosted considerably by recent<br>advances in associated algorithms and software, as well as increased<br>computational capabilities. As a result, it has become possible to address<br>uncertainties in complex climate models more quantitatively. However, there<br>still remain numerous challenges when dealing with complex climate models. In<br>this work, we highlight and address some of these challenges, using the<br>Community Land Model (CLM) as the main benchmark system for algorithm development.<br><br>To begin with, climate models are computationally intensive.  This necessarily disqualifies pure Monte-Carlo algorithms for uncertainty estimation, since naive Monte-Carlo approaches require too many sampled simulations for reasonable<br>accuracy. In this work, we build computationally inexpensive surrogate<br>model in order to accelerate both forward and inverse UQ methods.<br>We apply Polynomial Chaos (PC) spectral expansions to build surrogate<br>relationships between output quantities and model parameters using as few<br>forward model simulations as possible.<br><br>Next, climate models typically suffer from the \emph{curse of dimensionality}.<br>For example, the CLM depends on about 80 input parameters with somewhat<br>uncertain values. Representation of the input-output dependence requires<br>prohibitively many basis functions for spectral expansions. Moreover, to obtain<br>such a representation, one needs to sample an 80-dimensional space, which can at<br>best be \emph{sparsely} covered.  We apply Bayesian compressive sensing (BCS)<br>techniques in order to infer the best basis set for the PC surrogate model.  BCS<br>performs particularly well in high-dimensional settings when model simulations are very sparse.<br><br>Furthermore, many climate models incorporate dependent uncertain parameters. In<br>this context, we apply the Rosenblatt transformation, mapping dependent<br>parameters into a computationally convenient set of independent variables. This<br>allows efficient parameter sampling even in presence of dependencies.<br><br>Finally, as climate models can, and the CLM in particular \emph{does}, exhibit<br>sharp transients with varying input parameters, we consider multi-cluster PC<br>representations in which spectral expansions are obtained within each<br>sample set class, and combined accordingly using classification techniques.<br><br>The ultimate, multi-cluster PC surrogate model allows a global, variance-based<br>sensitivity analysis that can drastically reduce the input parameter space<br>dimensionality. Also, the PC surrogate model can be invoked, without much<br>computational overhead, in place of the full climate model, in optimization or<br>calibration studies that require prohibitively many forward model simulations. In<br>particular, we use PC surrogates to infer input parameter distributions given physical observations. At this stage, adaptive Markov chain Monte-Carlo<br>algorithms are used to explore the input parameter space efficiently.<br><br>This work is supported by the U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science,<br>Biological and Environmental Research, CSSEF (Climate Science for a Sustainable<br>Energy Future) program.
