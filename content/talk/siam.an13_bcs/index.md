abstract: "For complex models with a large number of input parameters,<br>surrogate model construction is challenged by insufficient<br>model simulation data as well as by a prohibitively large number of<br>parameters controlling the surrogate. Bayesian sparse learning approaches are<br>implemented in order to detect sparse-basis expansions that best<br>capture the model outputs. We enhanced the Bayesian compressive<br>sensing approach with adaptive basis growth and with a data-driven,<br>piecewise surrogate construction.<br><br><br>"
