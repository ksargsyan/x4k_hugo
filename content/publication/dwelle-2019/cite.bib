 abstract = {The scale and complexity of environmental and earth
systems introduce an array of uncertainties that need to be
systematically addressed. In numerical modeling, the
ever-increasing complexity of representation of these
systems confounds our ability to resolve relevant
uncertainties. Specifically, the numerical representation
of the governing processes involve many inputs and
parameters that have been traditionally treated as
deterministic. Considering them as uncertain introduces a
large computational burden, stemming from the requirement
of a prohibitive number of model simulations. Furthermore,
within hydrology, most catchments are sparsely monitored,
and there are limited, heterogeneous types of data
available to confirm the modelâ€™s behavior. Here we
present a blueprint of a general approach to uncertainty
quantification for complex hydrologic models, taking
advantage of recent methodological developments. We rely on
polynomial chaos machinery to construct accurate surrogates
that can be efficiently sampled for the ecohydrologic model
tRIBS-VEGGIE to mimic its behavior with respect to a
selected set of quantities of interest. The use of the
Bayesian compressive sensing technique allows for fewer
evaluations of the computationally expensive tRIBS-VEGGIE.
The approach enables inference of model parameters using a
set of observed hydrologic quantities including stream
discharge, water table depth, evapotranspiration, and soil
moisture from the Asu experimental catchment near Manaus,
Brazil. The results demonstrate the flexibility of the
framework for hydrologic inference in watersheds with
sparse, irregular observations of varying accuracy.
Significant computational savings imply that problems of
greater computational complexity and dimension can be
addressed using accurate, computationally cheap surrogates
for complex hydrologic models. This will ultimately yield
probabilistic representation of model behavior, robust
parameter inference, and sensitivity analysis without the
need for greater investment in computational resources.},
