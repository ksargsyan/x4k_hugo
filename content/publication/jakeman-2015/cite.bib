 abstract = {In this paper we present a basis selection method that can
be used with l1-minimization to adaptively determine the
large coefficients of polynomial chaos expansions (PCE).
The adaptive construction produces anisotropic basis sets
that have more terms in important dimensions and limits the
number of unimportant terms that increase mutual coherence
and thus degrade the performance of l1-minimization. The
important features and the accuracy of basis selection are
demonstrated with a number of numerical examples.
Specifically, we show that for a given computational
budget, basis selection produces a more accurate PCE than
would be obtained if the basis were fixed a priori. We also
demonstrate that basis selection can be applied with
non-uniform random variables and can leverage gradient
information.},
