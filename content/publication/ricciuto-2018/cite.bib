 abstract = {We conduct a global sensitivity analysis (GSA) of the
Energy Exascale Earth System Model (E3SM), land model (ELM)
to calculate the sensitivity of five key carbon cycle
outputs to 68 model parameters. This GSA is conducted by
first constructing a Polynomial Chaos (PC) surrogate via
new Weighted Iterative Bayesian Compressive Sensing (WIBCS)
algorithm for adaptive basis growth leading to a sparse,
high‚Äêdimensional PC surrogate with 3,000 model
evaluations. The PC surrogate allows efficient extraction
of GSA information leading to further dimensionality
reduction. The GSA is performed at 96 FLUXNET sites
covering multiple plant functional types (PFTs) and climate
conditions. About 20 of the model parameters are identified
as sensitive with the rest being relatively insensitive
across all outputs and PFTs. These sensitivities are
dependent on PFT, and are relatively consistent among sites
within the same PFT. The five model outputs have a majority
of their highly sensitive parameters in common. A common
subset of sensitive parameters is also shared among PFTs,
but some parameters are specific to certain types (e.g.,
deciduous phenology). The relative importance of these
parameters shifts significantly among PFTs and with
climatic variables such as mean annual temperature.},
