 abstract = {We present a resilient task-based domain-decomposition
preconditioner for partial differential equations (PDEs)
built on top of User Level Fault Mitigation Message Passing
Interface (ULFM-MPI). The algorithm reformulates the PDE as
a sampling problem, followed by a robust regression-based
solution update that is resilient to silent data
corruptions (SDCs). We adopt a server-client model where
all state information is held by the servers, while clients
only serve as computational units. The task-based nature of
the algorithm and the capabilities of ULFM complement each
other to support missing tasks, making the application
resilient to clients failing.We present weak and strong
scaling results on Edison, National Energy Research
Scientific Computing Center (NERSC), for a nominal and a
fault-injected case, showing that even in the presence of
faults, scalability tested up to 50k cores is within 90%.
We then quantify the variability of weak and strong scaling
due to the presence of faults. Finally, we discuss the
performance of our application with respect to subdomain
size, server/client configuration, and the interplay
between energy and resilience.},
