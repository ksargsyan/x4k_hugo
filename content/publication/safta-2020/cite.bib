 abstract = {We demonstrate a Bayesian method for the “real-time”
characterization and forecasting of partially observed
COVID-19 epidemic. Characterization is the estimation of
infection spread parameters using daily counts of
symptomatic patients. The method is designed to help guide
medical resource allocation in the early epoch of the
outbreak. The estimation problem is posed as one of
Bayesian inference and solved using a Markov chain Monte
Carlo technique. The data used in this study was sourced
before the arrival of the second wave of infection in July
2020. The proposed modeling approach, when applied at the
country level, generally provides accurate forecasts at the
regional, state and country level. The epidemiological
model detected the flattening of the curve in California,
after public health measures were instituted. The method
also detected different disease dynamics when applied to
specific regions of New Mexico.},
