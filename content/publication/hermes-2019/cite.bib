 abstract = {Identification and refinement of first order saddle point
(FOSP) structures on the potential energy surface (PES) of
chemical systems is a computational bottleneck in the
characterization of reaction pathways. Leading FOSP
refinement strategies for modestly sized molecular systems
require calculation of the full Hessian matrix, which is
not feasible for larger systems such as those encountered
in heterogeneous catalysis. For these systems, the standard
approach to FOSP refinement involves iterative
diagonalization of the Hessian, but this comes at the cost
of longer refinement trajectories due to the lack of
accurate curvature information. We present a method for
incorporating information obtained by an iterative
diagonalization algorithm into the construction of an
approximate Hessian matrix that accelerates FOSP
refinement. We measure the performance of our method with
two established FOSP refinement benchmarks and find a 50%
reduction on average in the number of gradient evaluations
required to converge to a FOSP for one benchmark and a 25%
reduction on average for the second benchmark.},
