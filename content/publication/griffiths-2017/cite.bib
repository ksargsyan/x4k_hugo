 abstract = {We are conducting a large-scale, long-term climate change
response experiment in an ombrotrophic peat bog in
Minnesota to evaluate the effects of warming and elevated
CO2 on ecosystem processes using empirical and modeling
approaches. To better frame future assessments of peatland
responses to climate change, we characterized and compared
spatial vs. temporal variation in measured C cycle
processes and their environmental drivers. We also
conducted a sensitivity analysis of a peatland C model to
identify how variation in ecosystem parameters contributes
to model prediction uncertainty. High spatial variability
in C cycle processes resulted in the inability to determine
if the bog was a C source or sink, as the 95% confidence
interval ranged from a source of 50 g C m^–2 yr^–1 to a
sink of 67 g C m^–2 yr^–1. Model sensitivity analysis
also identified that spatial variation in tree and shrub
photosynthesis, allocation characteristics, and maintenance
respiration all contributed to large variations in the
pretreatment estimates of net C balance. Variation in
ecosystem processes can be more thoroughly characterized if
more measurements are collected for parameters that are
highly variable over space and time, and especially if
those measurements encompass environmental gradients that
may be driving the spatial and temporal variation (e.g.,
hummock vs. hollow microtopographies, and wet vs. dry
years). Together, the coupled modeling and empirical
approaches indicate that variability in C cycle processes
and their drivers must be taken into account when
interpreting the significance of experimental warming and
elevated CO2 treatments.},
