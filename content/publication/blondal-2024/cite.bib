 abstract = {A new strategy is presented for computing anharmonic
partition functions for the motion of adsorbates relative
to a catalytic surface. Importance sampling is compared
with conventional Monte Carlo. The importance sampling is
significantly more efficient. This new approach is applied
to CH3* on Ni(111) as a test case. The motion of methyl
relative to the nickel surface is found to be anharmonic,
with significantly higher entropy compared to the standard
harmonic oscillator model. The new method is freely
available as part of the Minima-Preserving Neural Network
within the AdTherm package.},
