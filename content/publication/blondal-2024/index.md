abstract: "A new strategy is presented for computing anharmonic partition functions for the motion of adsorbates relative to a catalytic surface. Importance sampling is compared with conventional Monte Carlo. The importance sampling is significantly more efficient. This new approach is applied to CH3* on Ni(111) as a test case. The motion of methyl relative to the nickel surface is found to be anharmonic, with significantly higher entropy compared to the standard harmonic oscillator model. The new method is freely available as part of the Minima-Preserving Neural Network within the AdTherm package."
