 abstract = {In this paper we propose a probabilistic framework for an uncertainty quantification (UQ) study of a carbon cycle
model and focus on the comparison between steady-state and
transient simulation setups. A global sensitivity analysis
(GSA) study indicates the parameters and parameter
couplings that are important at different times of the year
for quantities of interest (QoIs) obtained with the data
assimilation linked ecosystem carbon (DALEC) model. We then
employ a Bayesian approach and a statistical model error
term to calibrate the parameters of DALEC using net
ecosystem exchange (NEE) observations at the Harvard Forest
site. The calibration results are employed in the second
part of the paper to assess the predictive skill of the
model via posterior predictive checks.},
