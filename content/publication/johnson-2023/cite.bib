 abstract = { Many important industrial processes rely on heterogeneous
catalytic systems. However, given all possible catalysts
and conditions of interest, it is impractical to optimize
most systems experimentally. Automatically generated
microkinetic models can be used to efficiently consider
many catalysts and conditions. However, these microkinetic
models require accurate estimation of many thermochemical
and kinetic parameters. Manually calculating these
parameters is tedious and error prone, involving many
interconnected computations. We present Pynta, a workflow
software for automating the calculation of surface and
gas–surface reactions. Pynta takes the reactants,
products, and atom maps for the reactions of interest,
generates sets of initial guesses for all species and
saddle points, runs all optimizations, frequency, and IRC
calculations, and computes the associated thermochemistry
and rate coefficients. It is able to consider all unique
adsorption configurations for both adsorbates and saddle
points, allowing it to handle high index surfaces and
bidentate species. Pynta implements a new saddle point
guess generation method called harmonically forced saddle
point searching (HFSP). HFSP defines harmonic potentials
based on the optimized adsorbate geometries and which bonds
are breaking and forming that allow initial placements to
be optimized using the GFN1-xTB semiempirical method to
create reliable saddle point guesses. This method is
reaction class agnostic and fast, allowing Pynta to
consider all possible adsorbate site placements
efficiently. We demonstrate Pynta on 11 diverse reactions
involving monodenate, bidentate, and gas-phase species,
many distinct reaction classes, and both a low and a high
index facet of Cu. Our results suggest that it is very
important to consider reactions between adsorbates adsorbed
in all unique configurations for interadsorbate group
transfers and reactions on high index surfaces. },
