 abstract = {A new method is proposed for a fast evaluation of
high-dimensional integrals of potential energy surfaces
(PES) that arise in many areas of quantum dynamics. It
decomposes a PES into a canonical low-rank tensor format,
reducing its integral into a relatively short sum of
products of low-dimensional integrals. The decomposition is
achieved by the alternating least squares (ALS) algorithm,
requiring only a small number of single-point energy
evaluations. Therefore, it eradicates a force-constant
evaluation as the hotspot of many quantum dynamics
simulations and also possibly lifts the curse of
dimensionality. This general method is applied to the
anharmonic vibrational zero-point and transition energy
calculations of molecules using the second-order
diagrammatic vibrational many-body Green's function (XVH2)
theory with a harmonic-approximation reference. In this
application, high dimensional PES and Green's functions are
both subjected to a low-rank decomposition. Evaluating the
molecular integrals over a low-rank PES and Green's
functions as sums of low-dimensional integrals using the
Gauss–Hermite quadrature, this
canonical-tensor-decomposition-based XVH2 (CT-XVH2)
achieves an accuracy of 0.1 cm^−1 or higher and nearly an
order of magnitude speedup as compared with the original
algorithm using force constants for water and
formaldehyde.},
