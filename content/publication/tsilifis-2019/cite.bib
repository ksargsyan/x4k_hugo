 abstract = {Basis adaptation in Homogeneous Chaos spaces rely on a
suitable rotation of the underlying Gaussian germ. Several
rotations have been proposed in the literature resulting in
adaptations with different convergence properties. In this
paper we present a new adaptation mechanism that builds on
compressive sensing algorithms, resulting in a reduced
polynomial chaos approximation with optimal sparsity. The
developed adaptation algorithm consists of a two-step
optimization procedure that computes the optimal
coefficients and the input projection matrix of a low
dimensional chaos expansion with respect to an optimally
rotated basis. We demonstrate the attractive features of
our algorithm through several numerical examples including
the application on Large-Eddy Simulation (LES) calculations
of turbulent combustion in a HIFiRE scramjet engine.},
