 abstract = {In this report, we proposed, examined and implemented
approaches for performing efficient uncertainty
quantification (UQ) in climate land models. Specifically,
we applied Bayesian compressive sensing framework to a
polynomial chaos spectral expansions, enhanced it with an
iterative algorithm of basis reduction, and investigated
the results on test models as well as on the community land
model (CLM). Furthermore, we discussed construction of
efficient quadrature rules for forward propagation of
uncertainties from high-dimensional, constrained input
space to output quantities of interest. The work lays
grounds for efficient forward UQ for high-dimensional,
strongly non-linear and computationally costly climate
models. Moreover, to investigate parameter inference
approaches, we have applied two variants of the Markov
chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method to a soil moisture dynamics
submodel of the CLM. The evaluation of these algorithms
gave us a good foundation for further building out the
Bayesian calibration framework towards the goal of robust
component-wise calibration.},
