 abstract = {We consider extinction times for a class of birth-death
processes commonly found in applications, where there is a
control parameter which defines a threshold. Below the
threshold, the population quickly becomes extinct; above,
it persists for a long time. We give an exact expression
for the mean time to extinction in the discrete case and
its asymptotic expansion for large values of the population
scale. We have results below the threshold, at the
threshold, and above the threshold, and we observe that the
Fokker--Planck approximation is valid only quite near the
threshold. We compare our asymptotic results to exact
numerical evaluations for the
susceptible-infected-susceptible epidemic model, which is
in the class that we treat. This is an interesting example
of the delicate relationship between discrete and continuum
treatments of the same problem.},
