 abstract = {We present a new geodesic-based method for geometry
optimization in a basis set of redundant internal
coordinates. Our method updates the molecular geometry by
following the geodesic generated by a displacement vector
on the internal coordinate manifold, which dramatically
reduces the number of steps required to converge to a
minimum. Our method can be implemented in any existing
optimization code, requiring only implementation of
derivatives of the Wilson B-matrix and the ability to
numerically solve an ordinary differential equation.},
