 abstract = {The use of simple models for response prediction of building structures is preferred in earthquake
engineering for risk evaluations at regional scales, as
they make computational studies more feasible. The primary
impediment in their gainful use presently is the lack of
viable methods for quantifying (and reducing upon) the
modeling errors/uncertainties they bear. This study
presents a Bayesian calibration method wherein the modeling
error is embedded into the parameters of the model. The
method is specifically described for coupled shear-flexural
beam models here, but it can be applied to any parametric
surrogate model. The major benefit the method offers is the
ability to consider the modeling uncertainty in the forward
prediction of any degree-of-freedom or composite response
regardless of the data used in calibration. The method is
extensively verified using two synthetic examples. In the
first example, the beam model is calibrated to represent a
similar beam model but with enforced modeling errors. In
the second example, the beam model is used to represent the
detailed finite element model of a 52-story building. Both
examples show the capability of the proposed solution to
provide realistic uncertainty estimation around the mean
prediction.},
