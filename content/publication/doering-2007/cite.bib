 abstract = {We investigate the near-continuum asymptotics of mean
first passage times in some one-variable birthâ€“death
processes. The particular problem we address is how to
extract mean first passage times in the near-continuum
limit from their defining finite-difference equations
alone. For the simple class of processes we consider here,
exact closed-form solutions for the mean first passage time
between any two states are available and the near-continuum
expansion of these formulae defines the correct limiting
behaviour and is used to check the results of asymptotic
analysis of the difference equations. We find that in some
cases the asymptotic approach does not lead unequivocally
to the proper result.},
