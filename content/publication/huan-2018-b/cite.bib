 abstract = {The development of scramjet engines is an important
research area for advancing hypersonic and orbital flights.
Progress toward optimal engine designs requires accurate
flow simulations together with uncertainty quantification.
However, performing uncertainty quantification for scramjet
simulations is challenging due to the large number of
uncertain parameters involved and the high computational
cost of flow simulations. These difficulties are addressed
in this paper by developing practical uncertainty
quantification algorithms and computational methods, and
deploying them in the current study to large-eddy
simulations of a jet in crossflow inside a simplified
HIFiRE Direct Connect Rig scramjet combustor. First, global
sensitivity analysis is conducted to identify influential
uncertain input parameters, which can help reduce the
systemâ€™s stochastic dimension. Second, because models of
different fidelity are used in the overall uncertainty
quantification assessment, a framework for quantifying and
propagating the uncertainty due to model error is
presented. These methods are demonstrated on a nonreacting
jet-in-crossflow test problem in a simplified scramjet
geometry, with parameter space up to 24 dimensions, using
static and dynamic treatments of the turbulence subgrid
model, and with two-dimensional and three-dimensional
geometries.},
