 abstract = {The development of scramjet engines is an important
research area for advancing hypersonic and orbital flights.
Progress towards optimal engine designs requires accurate
and computationally affordable flow simulations, as well as
uncertainty quantification (UQ). While traditional UQ
techniques can become prohibitive under expensive
simulations and high-dimensional parameter spaces,
polynomial chaos (PC) surrogate modeling is a useful tool
for alleviating some of the computational burden. However,
non-intrusive quadrature-based constructions of PC
expansions relying on a single high-fidelity model can
still be quite expensive. We thus introduce a two-stage
numerical procedure for constructing PC surrogates while
making use of multiple models of different fidelity. The
first stage involves an initial dimension reduction through
global sensitivity analysis using compressive sensing. The
second stage utilizes adaptive sparse quadrature on a
multifidelity expansion to compute PC surrogate
coefficients in the reduced parameter space where
quadrature methods can be more effective. The overall
method is used to produce accurate surrogates and to
propagate uncertainty induced by uncertain boundary
conditions and turbulence model parameters, for performance
quantities of interest from large eddy simulations of
supersonic reactive flows inside a scramjet engine.},
