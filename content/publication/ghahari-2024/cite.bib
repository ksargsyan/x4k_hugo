 abstract = {Abstract Understanding and accurately characterizing
energy dissipation mechanisms in civil structures during
earthquakes is an important element of seismic assessment
and design. The most commonly used model is attributed to
Rayleigh. This paper proposes a systematic approach to
quantify the uncertainty associated with Rayleigh's damping
model. Bayesian calibration with embedded model error is
employed to treat the coefficients of the Rayleigh model as
random variables using modal damping ratios. Through a
numerical example, we illustrate how this approach works
and how the calibrated model can address modeling
uncertainty associated with the Rayleigh damping model.},
