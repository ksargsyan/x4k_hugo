 abstract = {We discuss algorithm-based resilience to silent data
corruptions (SDCs) in a task-based domain-decomposition
preconditioner for partial differential equations (PDEs).
The algorithm exploits a reformulation of the PDE as a
sampling problem, followed by a solution update through
data manipulation that is resilient to SDCs. The
implementation is based on a server-client model where all
state information is held by the servers, while clients are
designed solely as computational units. Scalability tests
run up to ∼51K cores show a parallel efficiency greater
than 90%. We use a 2D elliptic PDE and a fault model based
on random single and double bit-flip to demonstrate the
resilience of the application to synthetically injected
SDC. We discuss two fault scenarios: one based on the
corruption of all data of a target task, and the other
involving the corruption of a single data point. We show
that for our application, given the test problem
considered, a four-fold increase in the number of faults
only yields a 2% change in the overhead to overcome their
presence, from 7% to 9%. We then discuss potential savings
in energy consumption via dynamic voltage/frequency
scaling, and its interplay with fault-rates, and
application overhead.},
