 abstract = {In this paper, a series of algorithms are proposed to
address the problems in the NASA Langley Research Center
Multidisciplinary Uncertainty Quantification Challenge. A
Bayesian approach is employed to characterize and calibrate
the epistemic parameters based on the available data,
whereas a variance-based global sensitivity analysis is
used to rank the epistemic and aleatory model parameters. A
nested sampling of the aleatoryâ€“epistemic space is
proposed to propagate uncertainties from model parameters
to output quantities of interest.},
