 abstract = {The development of scramjet engines is an important research area for advancing hypersonic and orbital flights. Progress towards optimal engine designs requires both accurate
flow simulations as well as uncertainty quantification (UQ). However, performing UQ for
scramjet simulations is challenging due to the large number of uncertain parameters involved and the high computational cost of flow simulations. We address these difficulties
by combining UQ algorithms and numerical methods to the large eddy simulation of the
HIFiRE scramjet configuration. First, global sensitivity analysis is conducted to identify
influential uncertain input parameters, helping reduce the stochastic dimension of the problem and discover sparse representations. Second, as models of different fidelity are available
and inevitably used in the overall UQ assessment, a framework for quantifying and propagating the uncertainty due to model error is introduced. These methods are demonstrated
on a non-reacting scramjet unit problem with parameter space up to 24 dimensions, using 2D and 3D geometries with static and dynamic treatments of the turbulence subgrid
model.},
