abstract: "The development of scramjet engines is an important research area for advancing hypersonic and orbital flights. Progress towards optimal engine designs requires both accurate flow simulations as well as uncertainty quantification (UQ). However, performing UQ for scramjet simulations is challenging due to the large number of uncertain parameters involved and the high computational cost of flow simulations. We address these difficulties by combining UQ algorithms and numerical methods to the large eddy simulation of the HIFiRE scramjet configuration. First, global sensitivity analysis is conducted to identify influential uncertain input parameters, helping reduce the stochastic dimension of the problem and discover sparse representations. Second, as models of different fidelity are available and inevitably used in the overall UQ assessment, a framework for quantifying and propagating the uncertainty due to model error is introduced. These methods are demonstrated on a non-reacting scramjet unit problem with parameter space up to 24 dimensions, using 2D and 3D geometries with static and dynamic treatments of the turbulence subgrid model."
