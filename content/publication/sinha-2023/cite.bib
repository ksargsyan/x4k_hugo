 abstract = {Abstract Perennial bioenergy crops are increasingly
important for the production of ethanol and other renewable
fuels, and as part of an agricultural system that alters
the climate through its impact on biogeophysical and
biogeochemical properties of the terrestrial ecosystem. Few
Earth System Models (ESMs) represent such crops, however.
In this study, we expand the Energy Exascale Earth System
Land Model to include perennial bioenergy crops with a high
potential for mitigating climate change. We focus on
high-productivity miscanthus and switchgrass, estimating
various parameters associated with their different growth
stages and performing a global sensitivity analysis to
identify and optimize these parameters. The sensitivity
analysis identifies five parameters associated with
phenology, carbon/nitrogen allocation, stomatal
conductance, and maintenance respiration as the most
sensitive parameters for carbon and energy fluxes. We
calibrated and validated the model against observations and
found that the model closely captures the observed
seasonality and the magnitude of carbon fluxes. The
validated model represents the latent heat flux fairly
well, but sensible heat flux for miscanthus is not well
captured. Finally, we validated the model against observed
leaf area index (LAI) and harvest amount and found modeled
LAI captured observed seasonality, although the model
underestimates LAI and harvest amount. This work provides a
foundation for future ESM analyses of the interactions
between perennial bioenergy crops and carbon, water, and
energy dynamics in the larger Earth system, and sets the
stage for studying the impact of future biofuel expansion
on climate and terrestrial systems.},
