 abstract = {Primary focal area: 2 (Predictive Modeling via AI): We
develop methods to formally quantify uncertainties in Earth
System models for the land-atmosphere coupled system.
Science Challenge: Earth system models still have
significant biases in historical predictions of the
intensity and frequency of water cycling extremes (e.g.,
droughts and flood events), leading to low confidence in
future projections. Uncertainties arise from incomplete
understanding of land and atmospheric processes, and
insufficient observational constraints on model parameters.
Many observations, including those from key DOE investments
such as ARM and AmeriFlux, are used to evaluate model
performance but have not been used to formally quantify
model uncertainty because of the expense of running ESM
simulations. An efficient pipeline engaging cutting-edge
machine learning (ML) and uncertainty quantification (UQ)
methods is needed to improve the predictive understanding
of water cycle extremes in the Earth system.},
