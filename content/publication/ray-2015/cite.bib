 abstract = {We present results from the Bayesian calibration of
hydrological parameters of the Community Land Model (CLM),
which is often used in climate simulations and Earth system
models. A statistical inverse problem is formulated for
three hydrological parameters, conditioned on observations
of latent heat surface fluxes over 48 months. Our
calibration method uses polynomial and Gaussian process
surrogates of the CLM and solves the parameter estimation
problem using a Markov chain Monte Carlo sampler. Posterior
probability densities for the parameters are developed for
two sites with different soil and vegetation covers. Our
method also allows us to examine the structural error in
the CLM under two error models. We find that accurate
surrogate models could be created for the CLM in three out
of the four cases we investigated. The posterior
distributions lead to better prediction than the default
parameter values in CLM. Climatologically averaging the
observations does not modify the parameters' distributions
significantly. The structural error model reveals a
correlation time-scale which can potentially be used to
identify physical processes that could be contributing to
the structural error. While the calibrated CLM has a higher
predictive skill, the calibration is underdispersive.},
