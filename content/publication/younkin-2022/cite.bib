 abstract = {A Bayesian inference strategy has been used to estimate
uncertain inputs to global impurity transport code (GITR)
modeling predictions of tungsten erosion and migration in
the linear plasma device, PISCES-A. This allows
quantification of GITR output uncertainty based on the
uncertainties in measured PISCES-A plasma electron density
and temperature profiles (n_e, T_e) used as inputs to GITR.
The technique has been applied for comparison to dedicated
experiments performed for high (4 x 1022 m−2 s−1) and
low (5 x 1021 m−2 s−1) flux 250 eV He–plasma exposed
tungsten (W) targets designed to assess the net and gross
erosion of tungsten, and corresponding W impurity
transport. The W target design and orientation, impurity
collector, and diagnostics, have been designed to eliminate
complexities associated with tokamak divertor plasma
exposures (inclined target, mixed plasma species,
re-erosion, etc) to benchmark results against the trace
impurity transport model simulated by GITR. The simulated
results of the erosion, migration, and re-deposition of W
during the experiment from the GITR code coupled to
materials response models are presented. Specifically, the
modeled and experimental W I emission spectroscopy data for
a 429.4 nm line and net erosion through the target and
collector mass difference measurements are compared. The
methodology provides predictions of observable quantities
of interest with quantified uncertainty, allowing
estimation of moments, together with the sensitivities to
plasma temperature and density.},
