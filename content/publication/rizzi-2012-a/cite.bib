 abstract = {This work focuses on quantifying the effect of intrinsic
(thermal) noise and parametric uncertainty in molecular
dynamics (MD) simulations. We consider isothermal, isobaric
MD simulations of TIP4P (or four-site) water at ambient
conditions, $T=298$ K and $P=1$ atm. Parametric uncertainty
is assumed to originate from three force-field parameters
that are parametrized in terms of standard uniform random
variables. The thermal fluctuations inherent in MD
simulations combine with parametric uncertainty to yield
nondeterministic, noisy MD predictions of bulk water
properties. Relying on polynomial chaos (PC) expansions, we
develop a framework that enables us to isolate the impact
of parametric uncertainty on the MD predictions and control
the effect of the intrinsic noise. We construct the PC
representations of quantities of interest (QoIs) using two
different approaches: nonintrusive spectral projection
(NISP) and Bayesian inference. We verify a priori the
legitimacy of the NISP approach by verifying that the MD
data satisfy regularity and smoothness conditions in the
parameter space. The Bayesian inference approach relies on
adaptively sampling the parameter space, based on analyzing
the convergence of the PC expansions at different
approximation levels. We show that for the present case,
the effect of the thermal noise in the atomistic system can
be controlled, and the MD predictions for the QoIs can be
suitably represented using low-order PC models.},
