 abstract = {The UQ Toolkit (UQTk) is a collection of tools for
uncertainty quantification, ranging from intrusive and
nonintrusive forward propagation of uncertainty to inverse
problems and sensitivity analysis. This chapter first
outlines the UQTk design philosophy, followed by an
overview of the available methods and the way they are
implemented in UQTk. The second part of this chapter is a
detailed example that illustrates a UQ workflow from
surrogate construction, and calibration, to forward
propagation and attribution.},
