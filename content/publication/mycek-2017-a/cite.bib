 abstract = {A resilient method is developed for the solution of
uncertain elliptic PDEs on extreme scale platforms. The
method is based on a hybrid domain decomposition,
polynomial chaos (PC) framework that is designed to address
soft faults. Specifically, parallel and independent solves
of multiple deterministic local problems are used to define
PC representations of local Dirichlet boundary-to-boundary
maps that are used to reconstruct the global solution. A
LAD-lasso type regression is developed for this purpose.
The performance of the resulting algorithm is tested on an
elliptic equation with an uncertain diffusivity field.
Different test cases are considered in order to analyze the
impacts of correlation structure of the uncertain
diffusivity field, the stochastic resolution, as well as
the probability of soft faults. In particular, the
computations demonstrate that, provided sufficiently many
samples are generated, the method effectively overcomes the
occurrence of soft faults.},
