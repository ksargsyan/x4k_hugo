 abstract = {We present a resilient domain-decomposition preconditioner
for partial differential equations (PDEs). The algorithm
reformulates the PDE as a sampling problem, followed by a
solution update through data manipulation that is resilient
to both soft and hard faults. We discuss an implementation
based on a server-client model where all state information
is held by the servers, while clients are designed solely
as computational units. Servers are assumed to be
“sandboxed”, while no assumption is made on the
reliability of the clients. We explore the scalability of
the algorithm up to ∼12k cores, build an SST/macro
skeleton to extrapolate to ~50k cores, and show the
resilience under simulated hard and soft faults for a 2D
linear Poisson equation.},
