 abstract = {In this work, the surface response of a tungsten
plasma-facing component was simulated by a cluster-dynamics
code, Xolotl, with a focus on quantifying the impact of
uncertainty in one of the input parameters to Xolotl,
namely, the incident helium flux. The simulated conditions
involve a tungsten surface exposed to 100 eV helium ion
implantations with a flux of either 4 x 1022 or 4 Ã— 1025
He m-2 s-1. Two sources were used to describe the implanted
helium depth distribution in tungsten, either molecular
dynamics (MD) or a binary collision approximation code, the
stopping and range of ions in matter (SRIM). The aim of
this work is to evaluate and examine uncertain predictions
on the helium retention based on these two different
modeling methodologies that either neglect electronic
energy loss or the crystalline structure of the solid,
respectively. An embedded model-form error approach was
pursued here in order to arrive at predictions that account
for variability due to the two different data sources, and
the impact of this model-form uncertainty in incident
helium flux on Xolotl output was presented for the two
implantation fluxes.},
