 abstract = {Uncertainty quantification in climate models is challenged
by the sparsity of the available climate data due to the
high computational cost of the model runs. Another feature
that prevents classical uncertainty analyses from being
easily applicable is the bifurcative behavior in the
climate data with respect to certain parameters. A typical
example is the Meridional Overturning Circulation in the
Atlantic Ocean. The maximum overturning stream function
exhibits discontinuity across a curve in the space of two
uncertain parameters, namely climate sensitivity and CO2
forcing. We develop a methodology that performs uncertainty
quantification in this context in the presence of limited
data.},
