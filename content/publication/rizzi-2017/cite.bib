 abstract = {We present a domain-decomposition-based preconditioner for
the solution of partial differential equations (PDEs) that
is resilient to both soft and hard faults. The algorithm
reformulates the PDE as a sampling problem, followed by a
solution update through data manipulation that is resilient
to both soft and hard faults. This reformulation allows us
to recast the problem as a set of independent tasks, and
exploit data locality to reduce global communication. We
discuss two different parallel implementations: (a) a
single program multiple data (SPMD) version based on a
one-to-one mapping between subdomain and MPI processes
responsible for both state and computation; and (b) an
asynchronous server–client implementation where all state
information is held by the servers and clients are designed
solely as computational units. We present a scalability
comparison of both implementations under nominal
conditions, showing efficiency within ~80% for up to 12,000
cores. We present a resilience analysis under different
fault scenarios based on the server–client
implementation. This framework provides resiliency to hard
faults such that if a client crashes, it stops asking for
work, and the servers simply distribute the work among all
of the other clients alive. Erroneous subdomain solves
(e.g. due to soft faults) appear as corrupted data, which
is either rejected if that causes a task to fail, or is
seamlessly filtered out during the regression stage through
a suitable noise model. Three different types of faults are
modeled: hard faults modeling nodes (or clients) crashing;
soft faults occurring during the communication of the tasks
between server and clients; and soft faults occurring
during task execution. We demonstrate the resiliency of the
approach for a 2D elliptic PDE, and explore the effect of
the faults at various failure rates.},
