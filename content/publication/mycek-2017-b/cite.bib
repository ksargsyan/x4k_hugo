 abstract = {A priori bounds are derived for the discrete solution of
second-order elliptic partial differential equations
(PDEs). The bounds have two contributions. First, the
influence of boundary conditions is taken into account
through a discrete maximum principle. Second, the
contribution of the source field is evaluated in a fashion
similar to that used in the treatment of the continuous a
priori operators. Closed form expressions are, in
particular, obtained for the case of a conservative,
second-order finite difference approximation of the
diffusion equation with variable scalar diffusivity. The
bounds are then incorporated into a resilient domain
decomposition framework, in order to verify the
admissibility of local PDE solutions. The computations
demonstrate that the bounds are able to detect most system
faults, and thus considerably enhance the resilience and
the overall performance of the solver.},
