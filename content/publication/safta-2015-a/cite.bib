 abstract = {Direct solutions of the Chemical Master Equation (CME)
governing Stochastic Reaction Networks (SRNs) are generally
prohibitively expensive due to excessive numbers of
possible discrete states in such systems. To enhance
computational efficiency we develop a hybrid approach where
the evolution of states with low molecule counts is treated
with the discrete CME model while that of states with large
molecule counts is modeled by the continuum Fokker–Planck
equation. The Fokker–Planck equation is discretized using
a 2nd order finite volume approach with appropriate
treatment of flux components. The numerical construction at
the interface between the discrete and continuum regions
implements the transfer of probability reaction by reaction
according to the stoichiometry of the system. The
performance of this novel hybrid approach is explored for a
two-species circadian model with computational efficiency
gains of about one order of magnitude.},
