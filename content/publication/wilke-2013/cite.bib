 abstract = {Simulation of high-performance computing (HPC) systems
plays a critical role in their development - especially as
HPC moves toward the co-design model used for embedded
systems, tying hardware and software into a unified design
cycle. Exploring system-wide tradeoffs in hardware,
middleware and applications using high-fidelity
cycle-accurate simulation, however, is far too costly.
Coarse-grained methods can provide efficient, accurate
simulation but require rigorous uncertainty quantification
(UQ) before using results to support design decisions. We
present here SST/macro, a coarse-grained structural
simulator providing flexible congestion models for low-cost
simulation. We explore the accuracy limits of
coarse-grained simulation by deriving error distributions
of model parameters using Bayesian inference. Propagating
these uncertainties through the model, we demonstrate
SST/macroâ€™s utility in making conclusions about
performance tradeoffs for a series of MPI collectives.
Low-cost and high-accuracy simulations coupled with UQ
methodology make SST/macro a powerful tool for rapidly
prototyping systems to aid extreme-scale HPC co-design.},
