 abstract = {Bayesian inference with a simple Gaussian error model is
used to efficiently compute prediction variances for
energies, forces, and stresses in the linear SNAP
interatomic potential. The prediction variance is shown to
have a strong correlation with the absolute error over
approximately 24 orders of magnitude. Using this prediction
variance, an active learning algorithm is constructed to
iteratively train a potential by selecting the structures
with the most uncertain properties from a pool of candidate
structures. The relative importance of the energy, force,
and stress errors in the objective function is shown to
have a strong impact upon the trajectory of their
respective net error metrics when running the active
learning algorithm. Batched training of different batch
sizes is also tested against singular structure updates,
and it is found that batches can be used to significantly
reduce the number of retraining steps required with only
minor impact on the active learning trajectory.},
