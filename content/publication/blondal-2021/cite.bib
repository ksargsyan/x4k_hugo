 abstract = {A new method for computing anharmonic thermophysical
properties for adsorbates on metal surfaces is presented.
Classical Monte Carlo phase space integration is performed
to calculate the partition function for the motion of a
hydrogen atom on Cu(111). A minima-preserving neural
network potential energy surface is used within the
integration routine. Two different sampling schema for
generating the training data are presented, and two
different density functionals are used. The results are
benchmarked against direct state counting results by using
discrete variable representation. The phase space
integration results are in excellent quantitative agreement
with the benchmark results. Additionally, both the discrete
variable representation and the phase space integration
results confirm that the motion of H on Cu(111) is highly
anharmonic. The results were applied to calculate the free
energy of dissociative adsorption of H2 and the resulting
Langmuir isotherms at 400, 800, and 1200 K in a partial
pressure range of 0–1 bar. It shows that the anharmonic
effects lead to significantly higher predicted surface site
fractions of hydrogen.},
