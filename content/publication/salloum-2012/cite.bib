 abstract = {We present a methodology to assess the predictive fidelity
of multiscale simulations by incorporating uncertainty in
the information exchanged between the atomistic and
continuum simulation components. Focusing on uncertainty
due to finite sampling in molecular dynamics (MD)
simulations, we present an iterative stochastic coupling
algorithm that relies on Bayesian inference to build
polynomial chaos expansions for the variables exchanged
across the atomistic-continuum interface. We consider a
simple Couette flow model where velocities are exchanged
between the atomistic and continuum components. To
alleviate the burden of running expensive MD simulations at
every iteration, a surrogate model is constructed from
which samples can be efficiently drawn as data for the
Bayesian inference. Results show convergence of the
coupling algorithm at a reasonable number of iterations.
The uncertainty associated with the exchanged variables
significantly depends on the amount of data sampled from
the MD simulations and on the width of the time averaging
window used in the MD simulations. Sequential Bayesian
updating is also implemented in order to enhance the
accuracy of the stochastic algorithm predictions.},
