 abstract = {Recent advances in high frame rate complementary
metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) cameras coupled with high
repetition rate lasers have enabled laser-based imaging
measurements of the temporal evolution of turbulent
reacting flows. This measurement capability provides new
opportunities for understanding the dynamics of
turbulence-chemistry interactions, which is necessary for
developing predictive simulations of turbulent combustion.
However, quantitative imaging measurements using high frame
rate CMOS cameras require careful characterization of the
their noise, non-linear response, and variations in this
response from pixel to pixel. We develop a noise model and
calibration tools to mitigate these problems and to enable
quantitative use of CMOS cameras. We have demonstrated
proof of principle for image de-noising using both wavelet
methods and Bayesian inference. The results offer new
approaches for quantitative interpretation of imaging
measurements from noisy data acquired with non-linear
detectors. These approaches are potentially useful in many
areas of scientific research that rely on quantitative
imaging measurements.},
