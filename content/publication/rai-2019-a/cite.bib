 abstract = {A method based on separated integration to estimate
anharmonic corrections to energy and vibration of molecules
in a second-order diagrammatic vibrational many-body
Green's function formalism has already been presented. A
severe bottleneck in extending this approach to bigger
molecules is that the storage of the Green's function
scales exponentially with the number of atoms in the
molecule. In this article, we present a method that
overcomes this limitation by approximating the Green's
function in the Hierarchical Tucker tensor format. We
illustrate that the storage cost is linear in dimension and
hence one can obtain accurate representations of the
Green's function for a molecule of any size. Application of
this method to estimate the second-order correction to
energy of molecules illustrates the advantage of this
approach.},
