 abstract = {We present a task-based domain-decomposition
preconditioner for partial differential equations (PDEs)
resilient to silent data corruption (SDC) and hard faults.

The algorithm exploits a reformulation of the PDE as a
sampling problem, followed by a regression-based solution
update that is resilient to SDC. We adopt a server-client
model implemented using the User Level Fault Mitigation MPI
(MPI-ULFM). All state information is held by the servers,
while clients only serve as computational units. The
task-based nature of the algorithm and the capabilities of
ULFM are complemented at the algorithm level to support
missing tasks, making the application resilient to hard
faults affecting the clients.

Weak and strong scaling tests up to ~115k cores show an
excellent performance of the application with efficiencies
above 90%, demonstrating the suitability to run at large
scale. We demonstrate the resilience of the application for
a 2D elliptic PDE by injecting SDC using a random single
bit-flip model, and hard faults in the form of clients
crashing. We show that in all cases, the application
converges to the right solution. We analyze the overhead
caused by the faults, and show that, for the test problem
considered, the overhead incurred due to SDC is minimal
compared to that from the hard faults.},
