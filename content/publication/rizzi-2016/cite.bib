 abstract = {We present a task-based domain-decomposition
preconditioner for partial differential equations (PDEs)
resilient to silent data corruption (SDC) and hard faults.
The algorithm exploits a reformulation of the PDE as a
sampling problem, followed by a regression-based solution
update that is resilient to SDC. We adopt a server-client
model implemented using the User Level Fault Mitigation MPI
(MPI-ULFM). All state information is held by the servers,
while clients only serve as computational units. The
task-based nature of the algorithm and the capabilities of
ULFM are complemented at the algorithm level to support
missing tasks, making the application resilient to hard
faults affecting the clients. Weak and strong scaling tests
up to ~115k cores show an excellent performance of the
application with efficiencies above 90%, demonstrating the
suitability to run at large scale. We demonstrate the
resilience of the application for a 2D elliptic PDE by
injecting SDC using a random single bit-flip model, and
hard faults in the form of clients crashing. We show that
in all cases, the application converges to the right
solution. We analyze the overhead caused by the faults, and
show that, for the test problem considered, the overhead
incurred due to SDC is minimal compared to that from the
hard faults.},
