 abstract = {We outline a methodology for forward uncertainty
quantification in systems with uncertain parameters,
discontinuous model response, and a limited number of model
runs. Our approach involves two stages. First we detect the
discontinuity with Bayesian inference, thus obtaining a
probabilistic representation of the discontinuity curve for
arbitrarily distributed input parameters. Then, employing
the Rosenblatt transform, we construct spectral
representations of the uncertain model output, using
polynomial chaos (PC) expansions on either side of the
discontinuity curve, leading to an averaged PC
representation of the forward model response that allows
efficient uncertainty quantification. We obtain PC modes by
either orthogonal projection or Bayesian inference, and
argue for a hybrid approach that targets a balance between
the accuracy provided by the orthogonal projection and the
flexibility provided by the Bayesian inference. The
uncertain model output is then computed by taking an
ensemble average over PC expansions corresponding to
sampled realizations of the discontinuity curve. The
methodology is demonstrated on synthetic examples of
discontinuous model response with adjustable sharpness and
structure.},
