 abstract = {We construct a global sensitivity analysis framework for a
coupled multiphysics model used to predict the changes in
material properties and surface morphology of helium
plasma-facing components in future fusion reactors. The
model combines the particle dynamics simulator F-TRIDYN,
that predicts the helium implantation profile, with the
cluster dynamics simulator Xolotl, that predicts the growth
and evolution of subsurface helium gas bubbles. In order to
keep the sensitivity analysis tractable, we first construct
a sparse, high-dimensional polynomial chaos expansion
surrogate model for each output quantity of interest, which
allows the efficient extraction of sensitivity information.
The sensitivity analysis is performed for two problem
settings: one for ITER-like conditions, and one that
resembles conditions inside the PISCES-A linear plasma
device. We present a systematic comparison of important
parameters, for both F-TRIDYN and Xolotl in isolation as
well as for the coupled model, and discuss the physical
interpretation of these results.},
