abstract: "We construct a global sensitivity analysis framework for a coupled multiphysics model used to predict the changes in material properties and surface morphology of helium plasma-facing components in future fusion reactors. The model combines the particle dynamics simulator F-TRIDYN, that predicts the helium implantation profile, with the cluster dynamics simulator Xolotl, that predicts the growth and evolution of subsurface helium gas bubbles. In order to keep the sensitivity analysis tractable, we first construct a sparse, high-dimensional polynomial chaos expansion surrogate model for each output quantity of interest, which allows the efficient extraction of sensitivity information. The sensitivity analysis is performed for two problem settings: one for ITER-like conditions, and one that resembles conditions inside the PISCES-A linear plasma device. We present a systematic comparison of important parameters, for both F-TRIDYN and Xolotl in isolation as well as for the coupled model, and discuss the physical interpretation of these results."
