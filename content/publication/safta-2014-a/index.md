abstract: In this paper we propose a series of methodologies to address the problems
  in the NASA Langley Multidisciplinary UQ Challenge. A Bayesian approach is employed
  to characterize and calibrate the epistemic parameters in problem A, while variance-based
  global sensitivity analysis is proposed for problem B. For problems C and D we propose
  nested sampling methods for mixed aleatory-epistemic UQ.
