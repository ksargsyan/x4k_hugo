 abstract = {In this paper we propose a series of methodologies to
address the problems in the NASA Langley Multidisciplinary
UQ Challenge. A Bayesian approach is employed to
characterize and calibrate the epistemic parameters in
problem A, while variance-based global sensitivity analysis
is proposed for problem B. For problems C and D we propose
nested sampling methods for mixed aleatory-epistemic UQ.},
