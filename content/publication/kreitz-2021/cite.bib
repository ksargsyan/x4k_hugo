 abstract = {Automatic mechanism generation is used to determine
mechanisms for the CO2 hydrogenation on Ni(111) in a
two-stage process while considering the correlated
uncertainty in DFT-based energetic parameters
systematically. In a coarse stage, all the possible
chemistry is explored with gas-phase products down to the
ppb level, while a refined stage discovers the core
methanation submechanism. Five thousand unique mechanisms
were generated, which contain minor perturbations in all
parameters. Global uncertainty assessment, global
sensitivity analysis, and degree of rate control analysis
are performed to study the effect of this parametric
uncertainty on the microkinetic model predictions.
Comparison of the model predictions with experimental data
on a Ni/SiO2 catalyst find a feasible set of microkinetic
mechanisms within the correlated uncertainty space that are
in quantitative agreement with the measured data, without
relying on explicit parameter optimization. Global
uncertainty and sensitivity analyses provide tools to
determine the pathways and key factors that control the
methanation activity within the parameter space. Together,
these methods reveal that the degree of rate control
approach can be misleading if parametric uncertainty is not
considered. The procedure of considering uncertainties in
the automated mechanism generation is not unique to CO2
methanation and can be easily extended to other challenging
heterogeneously catalyzed reactions.},
