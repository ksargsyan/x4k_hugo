 abstract = {We outline the use of a data-free inference procedure for
estimation of uncertain model parameters for a chemical
model of methane-air ignition. The method involves a nested
pair of Markov chains, exploring both the data and
parametric spaces, to discover a pooled joint posterior
consistent with available information. We describe the
highlights of the method, and detail its particular
implementation in the system at hand. We examine the
performance of the procedure, focusing on the robustness
and convergence of the estimated joint parameter posterior
with increasing number of data chain samples. We also
comment on comparisons of this posterior with the missing
reference posterior density.},
