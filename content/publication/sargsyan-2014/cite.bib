 abstract = {Uncertainty quantification in complex physical models is
often challenged by the computational expense of these
models. One often needs to operate under the assumption of
sparsely available model simulations. This issue is even
more critical when models include a large number of input
parameters. This "curse of dimensionality", in particular,
leads to a prohibitively large number of basis terms in
spectral methods for uncertainty quantification, such as
polynomial chaos (PC) methods. In this work, we implement a
PC-based surrogate model construction that "learns" and
retains only the most relevant basis terms of the PC
expansion, using sparse Bayesian learning. This
dramatically reduces the dimensionality of the problem,
making it more amenable to further analysis such as
sensitivity or calibration studies. The model of interest
is the community land model with about 80 input parameters,
which also exhibits nonsmooth input-output behavior. We
enhanced the methodology by a clustering and classifying
procedure that leads to a piecewise-PC surrogate thereby
dealing with nonlinearity. We then obtain global
sensitivity information for five outputs with respect to
all input parameters using less than 10,000 model
simulationsâˆ’a very small number for an 80-dimensional
input parameter space.},
